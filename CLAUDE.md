# Claude Workflow Contract

## Mission
Deliver secure, maintainable software with deterministic quality gates.

## Priority Order
1. Security
2. Correctness
3. Maintainability
4. Delivery speed
5. Token efficiency

## Kanban / Board
*Applies only when `SUBSYSTEM_BOARD=true` in `template.conf`. If it is off, use
plain GitHub issues and ignore this section.*

Work is tracked on a per-repo GitHub Project board (see `docs/KANBAN_WORKFLOW.md`).
- Agents pick up work with `/next-issue`, which claims a card collision-safely
  (`scripts/board.sh claim`: self-assign + `wip` + In Progress + re-check).
- Golden rule: never touch a card that is already assigned or In Progress. One
  branch and one PR (`Closes #<n>`) per story. Orchestrate epics with `/run-epic`.
- All board writes go through `scripts/board.sh` (gh-CLI, no secrets).

## Guardrails
- Never place credentials or tokens in repository files.
- Keep Claude auth in mounted user config outside workspace files.
- Run quality checks before merge: pre-commit, semgrep, gitleaks, CI checks.
- Respect repository protections and required checks.
- Keep `docs/explainer/index.html` in sync with `README.md` and `docs/`. It is a
  hand-authored visual briefing (the README is the source of truth); when the
  architecture, security gates, or component set change, update the explainer in
  the same PR. It is self-contained — no external requests, works offline and via Pages.

## Style
Default response style should be concise and precise.

## Project Instructions
Repository-specific instructions live in `docs/PROJECT.md`. Read that file as
well as this one; this contract governs security and quality gates, while the
project file covers what the repository actually is and how to operate it.

This repo started from
[claude_template_repo](https://github.com/Moon-Knight13/claude_template_repo)
but is **detached from template sync** — every file here is repo-owned. Keep
this contract about process; put project specifics in `docs/PROJECT.md`.
