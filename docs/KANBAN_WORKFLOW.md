# Kanban & Agent Orchestration

A GitHub Project v2 board turns planned work into trackable cards that a human
orchestrator hands off to Claude sessions — solo, or across a team without
agents stepping on each other. It is `gh`-CLI driven: no API keys, no secrets,
no Claude-in-CI. Claude acts through your interactive session and `gh`,
exactly as it does now.

## The board

Created per repo by `scripts/bootstrap-project.sh` — run automatically (best-effort)
by `scripts/setup-day0.sh` on container start once `gh` has the `project` scope; the
command below is the manual fallback.

| Surface | Values | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Status** (columns) | Backlog → Todo → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done | The at-a-glance overview and delivery stage |
| **Route** (field) | Human · Claude | Who should work the card |
| `agent-ready` (label) | — | Card is triaged and may be claimed by an agent session |
| `wip` (label) + assignee | — | Card is claimed; a claim lock — **do not touch** |

**Route** is the orchestration surface, set by the human during triage:

- `Human` — complex/high-risk (architecture, security, deep-debug, cross-cutting, risk=high).
- `Claude` — agentic work for a Claude session.

An old board may still show two retired surfaces from the upstream template:
a `Local` Route value and a **BMAD Stage** field. Both are stale metadata,
not instructions — work a `Local` card as Claude, and ignore or delete the
BMAD Stage field in the board UI.

## One-time setup (day 0)

`scripts/setup-day0.sh` runs this automatically once `gh` is authenticated with the
`project` scope (re-run it after auth, or it fires on the next container start). To do
it by hand — or to grant the scope, which is interactive:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s project              # grant Projects scope to your CLI (interactive)
APPLY=true bash scripts/bootstrap-project.sh   # create board, fields, labels
```

`bootstrap-project.sh` is idempotent — re-run it any time; it reconciles rather
than duplicates. It writes `.ai/project.env`, which `scripts/board.sh` sources.

## Solo flow

1. **Populate the board**: create issues from the Epic / User Story templates
   (they carry a suggested Route), then `bash scripts/board.sh add <n>`.
2. **Triage**: review each card, adjust Route, move the ones you want worked to
   **Ready**, and add `agent-ready`. Leave complex cards as `Route=Human`.
3. **Build**: `/next-issue` claims the top ready card, branches, implements, and
   opens a PR that closes the issue (card → In Review). Merge → move to Done.

## Team flow at scale

Everyone runs their own Claude Code session against the **shared per-repo board**.
Coordination is by construction:

- **Claim protocol.** `scripts/board.sh claim <n>` (used by `/next-issue`)
  self-assigns, adds `wip`, sets In Progress, then **re-reads** to confirm it is
  the sole assignee. If two sessions race, the loser releases and picks another
  card. A card is claimed exactly once.
- **The golden rule.** Never touch a card that is already assigned or In
  Progress. The assignee + `wip` + column tell you who is on what.
- **One branch per issue** (`issue-<n>-slug`) and **one PR per story** keep
  parallel work isolated; PRs use `Closes #<n>`.
- **Epic ownership.** `/run-epic <n>` claims the *epic* first, so two people
  don't fan out the same one. It then claims and distributes the child stories.
- **Parallel subagents** launched by `/run-epic` use git **worktrees**
  (`isolation: "worktree"`) so concurrent agents on one machine never clobber
  each other's files.

## The board CLI

`scripts/board.sh` is the single gh-native entry point (skills call it; you can
too):

```bash
bash scripts/board.sh add <n>                       # add issue, Status=Backlog
bash scripts/board.sh set-field <n> Route Claude    # set a field
bash scripts/board.sh move <n> in-review            # move a card
bash scripts/board.sh next                          # top Ready+agent-ready+unassigned
bash scripts/board.sh claim <n>                     # collision-safe claim
bash scripts/board.sh release <n>                   # undo a claim
```

## Why no CI automation?

Board writes are session-driven on purpose: it keeps the setup to two commands
with **zero stored secrets** and nothing to leak. The trade-off is that cards
move when you or a teammate act (or run `board.sh`), not automatically on GitHub
events. `/next-issue` and PR steps move the cards at the right moments.
